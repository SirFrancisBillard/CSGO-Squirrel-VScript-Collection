#CSGO Squirrel VScript Collection
A collection of game modes and little tidbits I have made in CS:GO VScript.
The language is Squirrel, a Lua and Javascript hybrid.
#How To Use
To use a game mode, simply put the prefab in your map and attach the script to your BSP
To use other scripts, execute them in game with script_execute <scriptname.nut>
